This README file contains details about how to run the traffic_counting program 
and other information about it.

# How to run unittest
python3 traffic_counter_test.py

# How to run the program
python3 traffic_counting.py <path_to_the_input_file>
for example:
python3 traffic_counting.py example_input

# Assumption
1. For output of the program, we print it to stdout
2. Assume missing record means 0 car passing. Eg, 
        '2021-12-02T00:00:00 1',
        '2021-12-02T01:00:00 2',
   is interpreted as the same of
        '2021-12-02T00:00:00 1',
        '2021-12-02T00:30:00 0',
        '2021-12-02T01:00:00 2',
    when counting traffic
3. Assume for output "The 1.5 hour period with least cars", we need to consider
    empty records. (records that missed in the input, implying 0 traffic)
